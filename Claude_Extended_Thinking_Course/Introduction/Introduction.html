<h1>Claude Extended Thinking - When and How to Use It</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
<p>Welcome to <strong>Claude Extended Thinking - When and How to Use It</strong>. This course is designed to provide you with a deep understanding of Claude's advanced reasoning capabilities, specifically the Extended Thinking feature. You will learn how to leverage this "thinking" phase to solve complex problems more accurately and efficiently.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Understand the mechanics</strong> of Claude's internal reasoning tokens and the "thinking" phase.</li>
    <li><strong>Configure and optimize thinking budgets</strong> based on task complexity and cost considerations.</li>
    <li><strong>Apply advanced prompting strategies</strong> that work synergistically with Extended Thinking.</li>
    <li><strong>Identify ideal use cases</strong> and differentiate between tasks that require extended thinking versus those that don't.</li>
    <li><strong>Analyze the trade-offs</strong> between response quality, latency, and token consumption.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>This course is intended for:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AI Developers and Engineers</strong> building applications with the Claude API.</li>
    <li><strong>Prompt Engineers</strong> looking to optimize model performance for complex reasoning tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Product Managers</strong> evaluating AI capabilities for sophisticated workflows.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>A basic understanding of LLMs and API-based interactions is recommended, but not required. Familiarity with JSON and basic programming concepts will be helpful for the API implementation sections.</p>

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>The course is organized into the following modules:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Module 1: Understanding Extended Thinking:</strong> Core concepts, mechanics, and budget optimization.</li>
    <li><strong>Module 2: Advanced Use Cases and Strategies:</strong> Practical application, prompting techniques, and scenario analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Pros and Cons:</strong> A critical look at the benefits and limitations of the technology.</li>
    <li><strong>Final Assessment:</strong> A comprehensive test of your knowledge across all modules.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to score <strong>70% or higher</strong> on each assessment to proceed.</p>

<h2>How to Navigate</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons at the bottom right to move through the course. Your progress is saved automatically, allowing you to resume at any time.</p>
