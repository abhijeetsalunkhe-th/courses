<h1>Advanced Prompting Strategies</h1>

<p>Extended Thinking changes how we approach prompt engineering. Instead of teaching the model <em>how</em> to think (e.g., via "Step-by-step" instructions), we focus on providing the model with the <strong>space and context</strong> it needs to reason effectively.</p>

<h2>Synergistic Prompting Techniques</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Budget-Aware Instructions:</strong> Explicitly tell Claude how to prioritize its thinking budget.
        <br/><em>Example: "Use your thinking budget to exhaustively check for edge cases in this security protocol."</em>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Delimited Multi-Step Tasks:</strong> Breakdown complex requests into clear phases. Even though Claude thinks internally, structured prompts help organize its reasoning.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-Critique Loops:</strong> Ask Claude to use its thinking phase to evaluate its own initial assumptions.
        <br/><em>Example: "Before answering, consider at least three alternative interpretations of this legal clause."</em>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Scenario: Deep Code Review</h2>
<p>In this scenario, we use Extended Thinking to perform a comprehensive security audit of a smart contract.</p>

<div class="code-block">
<pre><code># Prompting for depth
user_prompt = """
Audit this Solidity smart contract for reentrancy vulnerabilities.
1. Use your thinking phase to simulate multiple transaction flows.
2. Specifically look for state changes that happen after external calls.
3. Provide a detailed mitigation plan for any findings.
"""

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    max_tokens=10000,
    thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 6000},
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}]
)</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>The "Room to Reason" Pattern</h2>
<p>One of the most effective strategies is simply giving Claude a large enough budget and asking it to explore a problem space before committing. This is particularly useful for:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Open-ended Research:</strong> Exploring scientific literature or complex data sets.</li>
    <li><strong>Creative Brainstorming:</strong> Generating novel ideas while adhering to strict world-building rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Evaluating multi-year business goals against market variables.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Pitfall</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Solution</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Micromanagement</td>
        <td>Giving too many "how to think" instructions that conflict with the model's internal reasoning.</td>
        <td>Focus on <em>what</em> to analyze, not <em>how</em> to analyze it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Budget Starvation</td>
        <td>Setting a <code>budget_tokens</code> that is too low for the requested complexity.</td>
        <td>Match the budget to the task; use at least 4k tokens for non-trivial logic.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Instruction Overload</td>
        <td>Adding redundant CoT instructions (e.g., "Think step-by-step") when thinking is already enabled.</td>
        <td>Keep prompts concise; Extended Thinking handles the step-by-step logic automatically.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Workflow Integration</h2>
<p>Consider how Extended Thinking fits into your overall AI workflow. It is often the "Analysis" step in a larger pipeline:</p>
