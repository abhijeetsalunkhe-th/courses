<h1>What Is Extended Thinking?</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Extended Thinking is a sophisticated capability that allows Claude to engage in a dedicated <strong>reasoning phase</strong> before producing its final output. Unlike standard responses where the model generates text sequentially, Extended Thinking provides a "private" workspace for the model to work through complex logic, evaluate multiple hypotheses, and self-correct.</p>

<h2>The Mechanics of Thinking</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Thinking Tokens:</strong> These are internal tokens used by the model during the reasoning phase. They are billed at the same rate as output tokens but are distinct from the final visible response.</li>
    <li><strong>Budget Control:</strong> Developers can set a <code>budget_tokens</code> parameter to control how much "thought" Claude is allowed to use for a given request.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> While the thinking process is internal, the API returns it in a specific <code>thinking</code> block, allowing developers to monitor or display the model's reasoning process if desired.</li>
</ul>

<h2>API Implementation</h2>
<p>To enable Extended Thinking, you must use a supported model (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and include the <code>thinking</code> configuration in your API call.</p>

<div class="code-block">
<pre><code>import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    max_tokens=20000,
    thinking={
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 8000
    },
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this complex legacy codebase for potential race conditions..."}
    ]
)

# The response contains both thinking and text blocks
for block in response.content:
    if block.type == "thinking":
        print(f"Claude's Thoughts: {block.thinking}")
    elif block.type == "text":
        print(f"Final Answer: {block.text}")</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>When to Leverage Extended Thinking</h2>
<p>Extended Thinking is most effective for tasks that require deep analysis, multi-step planning, or complex problem-solving. It is <strong>not</strong> necessary for simple tasks where the answer is straightforward.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chain of Thought:</strong> The model inherently uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning without needing explicit "think step-by-step" prompts.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-Correction:</strong> Claude can identify errors in its own reasoning during the thinking phase and adjust its final response accordingly.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Leads to more consistent performance on high-difficulty benchmarks.</li>
</ul>
