    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Potential Limitations</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Enterprise pricing is higher than Pro or Free tiers, requiring a significant budget commitment.</li>
    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Setting up SSO and SCIM requires coordination with IT and Identity Provider (IdP) teams.</li>
    <li><strong>Regional Availability:</strong> Some enterprise features may have roll-out delays in specific geographic regions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security and Compliance Risks</h2>
<h3>Third-Party Data Processing</h3>
<p>While Anthropic offers enterprise-grade security, data is still processed on their servers. Organizations with extreme "air-gapped" requirements may find this challenging without specific VPC or on-prem options.</p>

<h3>Dependency on Single Provider</h3>
<p>Heavily integrating with Claude Enterprise features (like specific Artifacts workflows) can lead to vendor lock-in.</p>

<h2>Practical Considerations</h2>
<blockquote>
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use Workspaces to isolate different departments (e.g., Engineering vs. HR). This ensures that sensitive HR documents are never accidentally leaked into the Engineering workspace.
