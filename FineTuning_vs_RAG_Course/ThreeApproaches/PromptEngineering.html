<h1>Prompt Engineering: The Foundation</h1>

<h2>What is Prompt Engineering?</h2>
<p>Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting the input to an LLM to get the desired output. It is the first step in any AI project because it requires zero infrastructure changes and zero training costs. Often, a well-engineered prompt can solve problems that initially seem to require fine-tuning.</p>

<h2>Core Prompting Techniques</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Zero-Shot:</strong> Asking the model to perform a task without any examples.</li>
    <li><strong>Few-Shot:</strong> Providing 2-5 examples of the desired input and output within the prompt.</li>
    <li><strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT):</strong> Instructing the model to "think step-by-step" before providing a final answer.</li>
    <li><strong>System Instructions:</strong> Setting a persistent "persona" or "role" for the model (e.g., "You are a expert Python developer").</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advantages and Limitations</h2>
<table>
    <tr><th>Feature</th><th>Prompt Engineering</th></tr>
    <tr><td class="rowheader">Pros</td><td>Fastest to implement, zero cost (other than tokens), works with any LLM.</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="rowheader">Cons</td><td>Limited by context window, inconsistent for complex formatting, higher token cost per request.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Example: Few-Shot Prompting</h2>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code># Few-Shot Instruction for Sentiment Analysis
"Determine the sentiment of the following movie reviews.

Review: The movie was fantastic and the acting was superb!
Sentiment: Positive

Review: It was a complete waste of time. Avoid at all costs.
Sentiment: Negative

Review: The plot was interesting but the pacing was slow.
Sentiment: Neutral

Review: [User input goes here]
Sentiment:"</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>Practical Strategy</h2>
<blockquote>
<strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> Always start with prompt engineering. Only move to RAG or Fine-Tuning if prompt engineering fails to meet your requirements for accuracy, knowledge, or cost-efficiency.
