<h1>Architectural Pros and Cons</h1>

<p>Every architectural decision in a GenAI system involves trade-offs. Understanding these pros and cons is essential for building sustainable AI applications.</p>

<h2>Monolith Architecture</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Simplest to build, deploy, and debug. Lowest latency for internal communication.</li>
    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Hard to scale resource-intensive AI components independently. Single point of failure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Event-Driven Architecture</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent for long-running tasks. Highly scalable and resilient. Decouples expensive AI calls from the user-facing API.</li>
    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Increases system complexity. Requires managing message brokers and handling asynchronous state.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Serverless Architecture</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Automatic scaling from zero. Zero infrastructure management. Pay only for exact execution time.</li>
    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Cold starts can increase latency. Limited execution time and memory for very large AI pipelines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Comparison Matrix</h2>

        <td>Medium (Fixed)</td>
        <td>High (Broker cost)</td>
        <td>Low (Pay-per-use)</td>
    </tr>

        <td>Low</td>
        <td>High</td>
        <td>Low-Moderate</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Key Trade-offs in GenAI</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Latency vs. Cost:</strong> Premium models offer better results but at higher cost and latency. Caching reduces both but adds complexity.</li>
    <li><strong>Complexity vs. Scalability:</strong> Event-driven systems scale better but are harder to maintain than monoliths.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy vs. Convenience:</strong> Self-hosting models (Local/VPC) offers maximum privacy but requires significant infrastructure effort compared to using cloud APIs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Final Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Start with a Monolith</strong> for your MVP to validate the product-market fit quickly.</li>
    <li><strong>Move to Event-Driven</strong> once you have long-running tasks or need to scale background processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Implement Caching Early</strong> to save costs and improve user experience from day one.</li>
</ul>
