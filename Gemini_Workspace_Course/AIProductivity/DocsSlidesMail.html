<h2>Advanced Writing Assistance in Google Docs</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Contextual Rewriting:</strong> Highlight a paragraph and ask Gemini to "make it more persuasive" or "rephrase for a technical audience."</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Tone Adjustment:</strong> Use the "Help me write" sidebar to set specific tones such as "Confident," "Empathetic," or "Concise."</li>
    <li><strong>Information Synthesis:</strong> Ask Gemini to "Summarize the key takeaways from these meeting notes and format them as a table of action items."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visual Creativity in Google Slides</h2>
<p>Gemini transforms presentation design from a chore into a creative process:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Image Generation (Imagen 3):</strong> Generate custom, high-quality images for your slides by describing them in natural language (e.g., "A futuristic city with sustainable architecture, watercolor style").</li>
    <li><strong>Outline Generation:</strong> Provide a topic or a document, and Gemini will create a full slide deck outline with suggested content for each slide.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Consistency:</strong> Use Gemini to suggest color schemes and layouts that match your brand or the presentation's theme.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prompt Patterns for Slides</h3>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Feature</th>
        <th>Effective Prompt Example</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Help me visualize</td>
        <td>"An isometric view of a data center with glowing blue cables, professional photography style."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Outline deck</td>
        <td>"Create a 5-slide presentation about our new Q3 marketing strategy based on [MarketingDoc.pdf]."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="rowheader">Speaker notes</td>
        <td>"Write professional speaker notes for this slide focusing on the three main statistics shown."</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Best Practices for Collaborative Writing</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Provide Context:</strong> Tell Gemini who the audience is and what the goal of the document is.</li>
    <li><strong>Iterate:</strong> Don't settle for the first draft. Use the "Refine" tools to perfect the output.</li>
    <li><strong>Fact-Check:</strong> Always review the AI-generated content for accuracy, especially when it involves specific names, dates, or technical data.</li>
